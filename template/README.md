# Template WebGL project for Mac
## Description
Inspired by [this fantastic tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kB0ZVUrI4Aw&list=PLjcVFFANLS5zH_PeKC6I8p0Pt1hzph_rt), I am creating a template for 3D WebGL projects from scratch and avoiding as much as possible the use of external libraries.

Unit tests are also included.

An installer file for MacOS is also provided to setup the environment in one click (actually, a double click).

## Instructions
### Setup the project
- Clone repository
- run ```./install-mac```
### Run the WebGL application
- run ```./scripts/run-all```
### Uninstall:
- run ```./scripts/uninstall-mac```
